# Students Analysis

In this project, we analyzed and visualized the Application, Admission, and Enrollment datasets using Python3 and Tableau public.




## Installation 

Install the python package with pip

```bash 
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

## run 
```bash 
python main.py
```

Due to privacy, the /data folder is not shared, which includes three files.

```bash 
.
├── CC_Admissions_4_Dr_Borcea.xlsx
├── CC_Applications_4_Dr_Borcea.xlsx
├── CC_Enrollments_4_Dr_Borcea.xlsx
```

The /output folder includes

```bash 
.
├── convert_JY.csv
├── enrollment_JY.csv
├── enrollment_track_JY.csv
└── yield_JY.csv
```

The output csv files are used to generate visualizations in Tableau public [Demo](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jun.yuan3070/viz/StudentAnalysisJun242021/EnrollmentTotalandProportion)

To update the visualization, one can download the Tableau workbook from the Demo link and update the output csv files.
